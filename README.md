## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project is a modernized version of the Cloud Resume Challenge, re-engineered for the 2026 DevSecOps landscape. It demonstrates a "Security-First" approach to cloud architecture, utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), AI-augmented development, and enterprise-grade CI/CD via Harness.io.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Cloud:** AWS (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, Route 53)
* **DevSecOps:** Harness.io, Snyk, Terraform, Checkov
* **Frontend:** Next.js (AI-generated via Windsurf)
* **Data/Analytics:** Supabase (PostgreSQL), n8n for automated workflows
* **Agile/PM:** Jira Framework

## 🚀 Project Roadmap (Jira Sprints)
### Phase 1: Planning & Agile Setup (Current)
- [x] Initialized Jira Scrum Board and Backlog.
- [x] Established GitHub/Jira Integration for Smart Commits.
- [ ] Technical Design Document (TDD) in Notion.

### Phase 2: AI-Augmented Frontend
- [ ] Component development using Windsurf/Cursor.
- [ ] Integration of visitor analytics via Supabase.

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & CI/CD
- [ ] Modular Terraform for AWS resource provisioning.
- [ ] Harness.io Pipeline for automated "Policy-as-Code" checks and deployment.

## 🛡 Security (DevSecOps) Implementation
* **Shift-Left:** Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret leakage.
* **IaC Scanning:** Checkov integration in the CI/CD pipeline to verify SOC2/NIST compliance.
* **Identity:** Least-Privilege IAM roles managed via Terraform.

## 📈 Business & Scalability
This project serves as a "Gold Image" for small-business web deployments. By automating the deployment and security audits, we reduce "Time to Market" for a professional web presence from days to minutes.
